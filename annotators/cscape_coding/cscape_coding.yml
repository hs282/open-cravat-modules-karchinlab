  desc: Scores are p-values. Scores above 0.5 are predicted to be deleterious, while those below 0.5 are predicted to be neutral or benign. P-values close to the extremes (0 or 1) are the highest-confidence predictions that yield the highest accuracy.

  title: Rank Score
  type: float
  desc: The rankscore is the ratio of the rank of the score over the total number of CScape scores.
