- name: status
  title: Status
  type: string
  desc: A pathogenic status of “Reported” indicates that a publication has considered the mutation as possibly pathologic. A status of “Cfrm” (confirmed) indicates that several independent laboratories have published strong evidence of the pathogenicity of a specific mutation.
