level: variant
output_columns:
- name: fathmm_mkl_coding_score
  title: Score
  type: float
  width: 60
  hidden: true
  desc: p-values. Scores range from 0 to 1. SNVs with scores >0.5 are predicted to be deleterious, and those <0.5 are predicted to be neutral or benign. 
- name: fathmm_mkl_coding_rankscore
  title: Rank score
  type: float
  width: 60
  hidden: false
  desc: Ratio of the rank of the score over the total number of FATHMM MKL scores.
- name: fathmm_mkl_coding_pred
  title: Prediction
  type: string
  width: 70
  hidden: false 
  category: single
  desc: If a score is >0.5 (or rankscore >0.28317) the corresponding nsSNV is predicted as "Damaging"; otherwise it is predicted as "Neutral"
- name: fathmm_mkl_group
  title: Feature Group
  type: string
  width: 60
  hidden: true
  desc: The groups of features (labeled A-J) used to obtained the score.
