- name: fathmm_xf_coding_score
  title: Score
  type: float
  desc: Scores are p-values and range from 0 to 1. SNVs with scores >0.5 are predicted to be deleterious, and those <0.5 are predicted to be neutral or benign.

  title: Rank score
  type: float
  desc: Ratio of the rank of the score over the total number of FATHMM XF scores.

  title: Prediction
  type: string
  desc: If score is >0.5, the corresponding nsSNV is predicted as "Damaging"; otherwise it is predicted as "Neutral".
